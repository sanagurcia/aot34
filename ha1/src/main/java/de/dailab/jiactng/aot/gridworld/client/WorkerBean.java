/* NOTES from skeleton:

class WorkerBean
 * this bean represents one of your Worker agents (i.e. each Worker Agent you initialize with this bean
 * will have a separate copy); it's structure will be similar to your Broker agent's
 *
 *
 * note that the number of workers may vary from grid to grid, but the number of worker
 * agents will always be the same (specified in the client.xml); you will have to have your Broker somehow tell
 * the worker agents which of them are currently needed and who may idle
 *
 * you could, theoretically, also control all your Workers from a single worker agent (and
 * bean), or even implement both the Broker and the Worker in the same bean, but that would
 * of course defeat the purpose of this exercise and may not be possible in "real life"

 void doStart()
 * this will be called once when the agent starts and can be used for initialization work
 * note that when this method is executed, (a) it is not guaranteed that all the other
 * agents are already started and/or their actions are known, and (b) the agent's execution
 * has not yet started, so do not wait for any actions to be completed in this method (you
 * can invoke actions, though, if they are already known to the agent)
 *
 *
 * You can use a SpaceObserver to listen to messages, but you can also check messages in execute()
 * and only temporarily attach a SpaceObserver for specific purposes
 *
 * As an example it is added here at the beginning.
