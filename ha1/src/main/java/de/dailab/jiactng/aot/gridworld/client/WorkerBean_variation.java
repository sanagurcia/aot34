	 * your new bean. You can find an example in the client.xml

	 * this is not the most elegant way to do this but since your Agent and AgentBean should represented
	 * the real world and for the sake of simplicity it is allowed/desired. There will be no point deduction
	 * for "bad coding" behavior on that matter.
